## 💼 Phase 4: Daily Operations
### "Your Staff, Your Way - With Full Visibility"

**All Filipino staff download and use our desktop application that provides:**

**Real-Time Activity Tracking:**
- ⏱️ Clock in/out timestamps
- 🖱️ Mouse movements & keyboard activity
- 💻 Active applications used
- 🌐 Websites visited
- 📸 Random screenshots (configurable frequency)
- 🚶 Idle detection (AFK warnings)

**Break Management:**
```

├─ Timer pauses
├─ Tracking stops

├─ Net Billable: 8h 15m
└─ Productivity Score: 87% (active time)

    ↓

├─ Client approved early leave
├─ Completed all assigned tasks
├─ Emergency (requires approval)

| Screenshots | ❌ No | ✅ Their staff | ✅ Everyone |

**The "Don't Embarrass Staff" Rule:**

---

### C. Support Tickets (Two Types!)

#### Type 1: Staff Tickets (Internal Issues)
**Examples:** "Mouse broken", "PC not working", "Need nurse visit", "Payroll question"

```
Staff creates ticket:
├─ Category: IT / Equipment / HR / Clinic / Cleaning
├─ Title: "Mouse not working"
├─ Description: "Left click button is stuck"
├─ Priority: High
├─ Attachments: Photo of broken mouse
└─ Submit
    ↓
System AUTO-ASSIGNS based on category:
├─ IT issues → IT Manager
├─ Equipment → IT Manager
├─ Clinic → Nurse/Operations Manager
├─ HR → HR Manager
├─ Cleaning → Operations Manager
└─ Management → Department Head
    ↓
Manager sees ticket → Responds
    ↓
Staff gets notification: "IT Manager replied: Coming in 5 min"
    ↓
Issue resolved → Manager marks "Resolved"
    ↓
Ticket closed ✅
```

**❗ Important:** Clients **DO NOT** see staff internal tickets.
- These are operations/management issues
- Not client's responsibility
- Maintains professional boundaries

---

#### Type 2: Client Tickets (Account Support)
**Examples:** "How do I give bonus?", "Change shift times?", "Billing question", "Platform help"

```
Client creates ticket:
├─ Category: Account Support / Platform Help / Billing / Staff Request
├─ Title: "How to give staff bonus?"
├─ Description: "Staff did great work, want to give bonus"
└─ Submit
    ↓
AUTO-ASSIGNED to Account Manager
    ↓
Account Manager sees ticket → Responds:
"Great! Here's how:
1. Go to Staff Profile
2. Click 'Request Bonus'
3. Fill amount + reason
4. We process within 24h"
    ↓
Client replies: "Thanks! Done!"
    ↓
Account Manager closes ticket
```

**Key Difference:**
- **Staff tickets** = Internal operations (PC, nurse, HR)
- **Client tickets** = Account support (billing, features, how-to)

     But remember, you love challenges - you're the guy 
     who plays Dark Souls for fun 😄
