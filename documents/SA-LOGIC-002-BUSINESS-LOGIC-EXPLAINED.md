# 🎯 002 - SHORE AGENTS LOGIC EXPLAINED

**The Simple Truth - How This BPO Platform Actually Works**

---

## 🏢 **THE BUSINESS MODEL (KEEP IT SIMPLE)**

### **3 Players in the Game:**

**1. CLIENT (USA/Australia/New Zealand companies)**
- Needs cheap labor
- Wants full-time Filipino staff
- **GIVES WORK DIRECTION** to the staff directly

**2. FILIPINO STAFF (The workers)**
- Works full-time for ONE client
- Gets work direction FROM the client
- Employed by Shore Agents (on paper)

**3. SHORE AGENTS MANAGEMENT (The middleman)**
- Recruitment
- HR, Payroll, Benefits
- Office management
- **DOES NOT give work direction to staff**
- **Client manages the work, we manage the employment**

---

## 💡 **KEY CONCEPT: WE ARE THE MIDDLEMAN**

```
Shore Agents (Employer)
    ↓
    Employs staff, handles HR/payroll/benefits
    ↓
Staff (Employee)
    ↓
    Works full-time for ONE client
    ↓
Client (Hires Staff)
    ↓
    Gives work direction, manages daily work
```

**NOT project-based freelance**
**ONLY full-time dedicated workers**
**ONE staff = ONE client**

---

## 🎯 **THE VALUE PROPOSITION**

**Old BPO = trust-based (no visibility)**
- Client has NO IDEA what staff is doing
- No proof of hours worked
- Hope they're working

**Shore Agents = data-driven (see everything)**
- Real-time transparency
- Proof of work
- Performance tracking
- Client sees curated professional view
- Management sees EVERYTHING for coaching

---

# 🚀 **RECRUITMENT TO ONBOARDING FLOW**

---

## **STEP 1: FINDING THE MORON**

**We have a separate recruitment platform** (AI-powered):
- Candidates apply
- Do personality tests
- Build resumes
- Get screened

---

## **STEP 2: CLIENT PICKS A MORON**

**Client Portal:**
1. Client browses candidates OR posts a job
2. Sees candidate profiles
3. Likes someone → Clicks **"Request Interview"**

**IMPORTANT:** Client requests in **THEIR timezone** (USA/AUS/NZ)

---

## **STEP 3: MANAGEMENT SCHEDULES INTERVIEW**

**Management Portal:**
1. Gets interview request
2. Sees client's preferred time (in client's timezone)
3. Management is in **Manila (MNL time)**
4. Candidate is in **Manila (MNL time)**

**Management's job:**
- Call the candidate
- Schedule interview as CLOSE to client's preferred time as possible
- IF candidate not available → find time that works for BOTH
- Book the interview

---

## **STEP 4: THE INTERVIEW**

- Client interviews candidate (video call)
- Management facilitates (sets it up)
- NOT giving work direction (that comes after hire)

**If good interview:**
- Client clicks **"Send Hire Request"**

---

## **STEP 5: HIRE PROCESS**

**Management Portal:**
1. Gets hire request
2. Management contacts candidate
3. Explains:
   - Start date (negotiate/set)
   - Shift time (night shift/day shift/mid shift)

**Candidate decision:**
- ✅ **ACCEPTS** → Move to onboarding
- ❌ **REJECTS** → Done, find another candidate

---

## **STEP 6: ONBOARDING (Candidate → Staff User)**

**If accepted:**

1. **Candidate signs up** (creates account via email)
2. **Email sent** with all recruitment process info
3. **Candidate logs in** (now becoming "staff")
4. **Signs contract** (digital signature)
5. **Completes onboarding** (7 steps):
   - Personal information
   - Government IDs
   - Background clearances
   - Education
   - Medical info
   - Employment contract
   - **Welcome Form** (get to know you - for AI personalization)

6. **Admin verifies** everything is good
7. **Onboarding COMPLETE**

---

## **STEP 7: WAITING FOR DAY 1**

**At this point:**
- ✅ Onboarding COMPLETE
- ✅ Start date SET
- ✅ Shift time SET (night/day/mid)
- ✅ Client sees schedule in THEIR timezone
- ✅ Staff sees schedule in THEIR timezone (Manila)
- ⏳ Staff is WAITING for start date

**Management installs Electron app on staff PC BEFORE Day 1**

---

# ⏰ **DAY 1: THE MAGIC HAPPENS**

---

## **SHIFT-BASED RECORDING = THE KEY LOGIC**

### **The Problem:**
If staff works past midnight, what day does it count as?

### **The Solution:**
**Everything is recorded against the SHIFT START DAY**

**Example:**
- Shift starts: Thursday 10:00 PM
- Staff works until: Friday 2:00 AM
- **ALL activity = Thursday shift**
- No confusion, no split days
- Simple

**This applies to:**
- Clock in/out times
- Breaks
- Tasks completed
- Analytics
- Everything

---

## **DAY 1: ELECTRON APP & CLOCK IN**

**Setup:**
1. Management already installed Electron on staff PC (before Day 1)
2. Staff logs into Electron app
3. Staff clicks **"Clock In"** when shift starts

**From here:**
- Clock in/out tracked
- Breaks tracked
- Activity tracked (mouse, keyboard, apps, URLs)
- **Transparent for BOTH client AND management**

---

# 👁️ **THE CRITICAL VISIBILITY LOGIC**

**This is what people keep fucking up:**

---

## **3-WAY PERMISSION MODEL:**

| Feature | Staff Sees | Client Sees | Management Sees |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Clock In/Out** | ✅ Their own | ✅ Their staff | ✅ ALL staff |
| **Breaks** | ✅ Their own | ✅ Their staff breaks | ✅ ALL breaks |
| **Time Entry Details** | ✅ Their own | ✅ Their staff | ✅ ALL entries |
| **Tasks** | ✅ Their tasks | ✅ Tasks they assigned | ✅ ALL tasks |
| **AI Assistant** | ✅ Their own chats | ❌ NO | ✅ ALL chats (if needed) |
| **Documents** | ✅ Their docs | ✅ Docs they uploaded | ✅ ALL documents |
| **Posts/Feed** | ✅ Their posts + team | ✅ Their staff posts | ✅ ALL posts |
| **Performance Reviews** | ✅ Their reviews | ✅ Reviews they filled | ✅ ALL reviews |

---

## **TICKETS = 2 SEPARATE SYSTEMS**

### **1. STAFF TICKETS (Internal Operations)**
**Who sees:**
- ✅ Staff (their own tickets)
- ✅ Management (all staff tickets)
- ❌ **CLIENT NEVER SEES**

**Examples:**
- "My mouse is broken"
- "I need to see a nurse"
- "PC issues"
- "HR question"

**Flow:**
```
Staff creates ticket → Management handles → Staff sees response
CLIENT NEVER INVOLVED
```

---

### **2. CLIENT TICKETS (Support/Questions)**
**Who sees:**
- ✅ Client (their own tickets)
- ✅ Management (all client tickets)
- ❌ Staff doesn't see

**Examples:**
- "How do I give my staff a bonus?"
- "Can I change shift times?"
- "Billing question"
- "Need help with platform"

**Flow:**
```
Client creates ticket → Management (Account Manager) handles → Client sees response
STAFF NEVER INVOLVED
```

---

## **ANALYTICS = THE "DON'T EMBARRASS STAFF" RULE**

### **CLIENT SEES (Professional, curated view):**
- ✅ Productivity score (e.g., 85%)
- ✅ Hours worked (8h 15m)
- ✅ Tasks completed (12/15)
- ✅ Active time vs idle time (high level)
- ✅ Professional metrics

### **CLIENT DOES NOT SEE (Embarrassing details):**
- ❌ Staff went to YouTube 22 times
- ❌ Staff checked Facebook at 10 AM
- ❌ Staff was idle for 12 minutes at 2 PM
- ❌ Specific website visits
- ❌ Raw granular data

### **MANAGEMENT SEES (Everything for coaching):**
- ✅ EVERYTHING
- ✅ YouTube visits (to address it)
- ✅ Facebook checks (to coach)
- ✅ Idle patterns (to improve)
- ✅ Raw data for performance talks
- ✅ Full transparency for internal use

**Why?**
- Clients get professional view (trust & confidence)
- Management gets raw data (coaching & improvement)
- Staff not embarrassed in front of client
- Everyone happy
